Usage

Invoke-Keystone requires an architecture appropriate (x32/64) compiled Keystone DLL.
A pre-compiled version can be found on the Keystone download page at the following
URL:

  * http://www.keystone-engine.org/download/

Once downloaded, the DLL should be placed in a directory which is part of the SafeDllSearchMode search order. In practice, any folder which is part of the Windows PATH environment variable will work.

The Invoke-Keystone function itself can be initialized using one of the following methods:

  * Script dot sourcing:

     PS C:\> . .\Invoke-Keystone.ps1

  * Adding the script to one of the PowerShell module directories:

     # Global PSModulePath path
     %Windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

     # User PSModulePath path
     %UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

Notes

The Keystone engine requires the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual
Studio 2013. The architecture relevant installer can be downloaded at the following
