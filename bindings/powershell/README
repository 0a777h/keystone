Usage

Compile the relevant version (x86/x64) of “keystone.dll” and place it in “./Keystone/Lib/Keystone/”. Alternatively, pre-compiled DLL’s can be obtained from the Keystone-Engine download page:

  * http://www.keystone-engine.org/download/

To use the PowerShell binding, the entire Keystone folder should be added to one of the PowerShell module directories:

  # Global PSModulePath path
  %Windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

  # User PSModulePath path
  %UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

Once this is done the module can be initialized by typing “Import-Module Keystone” in a new PowerShell terminal. Further information on the usage of the binding can be obtained with the following command:

  Get-Help Get-KeystoneAssembly -Full
